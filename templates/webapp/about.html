            Our goal in this web application is to allow users to upload and rate websites with ratings on them.
            For example, a website that allowed users to rate books and compare them with other books would be suitable to upload on to our webapp, users could then rate this website and comment on it.
            A link to a website without any sort of ratings would not be suitable to be uploaded.
